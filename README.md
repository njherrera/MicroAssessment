# MicroAssessment

Approaching the assessment

My first step in the process is to determine the structure of the project in terms of classes. My inclination is that all this project needs is a Main class and a Calculator class, but we'll see how that changes. In order to determine how to structure the classes, it's important to think about how the program will actually parse a given mathematical expression. Figuring this out will dictate the code's structure, specifically if I want to have the expression-parsing logic be in its own class. To do this, I started by going through the supplied example expressions top to bottom (easiest to hardest) and working through them mentally. As a side note, the part of this assessment that I see being the most difficult is finding a way to handle parentheses - I need to implement some way to check for parentheses, extract the expression inside them, then calculate the expression. To do this, I will likely need to use some sort of regular expression to split up the supplied mathematical expression - for example, with the example expression "(2 + 1) - (4 * 2)" we need to split the expression such that we end up with "{(2+1)}, {-}, {(4*2)}". After splitting the expression, we then work through it with the Calculator class's logic.

After thinking about my approach to the assessment more by working through parsing expressions, I think that going with two classes, Main, and Calculator is the best approach. I don't envision writing too many lines of code or methods (essentially just a parsing/splitting method, an overarching Calculate method, and one method for each operator that is called by the Calculate method), so based off that I don't think it'll be necessary to split up the code into smaller classes. However, splitting code into smaller and abstract classes would allow for easier extension of the code to add more operators - this is very relevant, especially in a collaborative environment where multiple people are working on the same project.

Parsing expressions

My first inclination is to do some sort of split to separate parts of the expression and/or checking to see if the expression contains "+", "-", "^", or "()", as well as cut out all the white spaces (this allows us to more cleanly work with the expression). The first step is cutting out all the white spaces, which calls for a fairly straightforward use of Java's replaceAll method. After a brief test in my Main method, I have verified that it works and the first step of parsing expressions is finished. Now that we have
